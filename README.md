# Nomad GCP Module

[![Maintained by Gruntwork.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20by-gruntwork.io-%235849a6.svg)](https://gruntwork.io/?ref=repo_google_nomad)
![Terraform Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/tf-%3E%3D0.12.0-blue.svg)

This repo contains a set of modules for deploying a [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) cluster on
[GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). Nomad is a distributed, highly-available
data-center aware scheduler. A Nomad cluster typically includes a small number of server nodes, which are responsible
for being part of the [consensus protocol](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/internals/consensus.html), and a larger
number of client nodes, which are used for running jobs.

## Features

* Deploy server nodes for managing jobs and client nodes running jobs
* Supports colocated clusters and separate clusters
* Least privilege security group rules for servers
* Auto scaling and Auto healing




## Learn

This repo is maintained by [Gruntwork](https://www.gruntwork.io), and follows the same patterns as [the Gruntwork
Infrastructure as Code Library](https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/), a collection of reusable,
battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. You can read [How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code
Library](https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library/) for an overview
of how to use modules maintained by Gruntwork!

### Core concepts

* [Nomad Use Cases](https://www.nomadproject.io/intro/use-cases.html): overview of various use cases that Nomad is
  optimized for.
* [Nomad Guides](https://www.nomadproject.io/guides/index.html): official guide on how to configure and setup Nomad
  clusters as well as how to use Nomad to schedule services on to the workers.
* [Nomad Security](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-nomad/tree/master/modules/nomad-cluster#security): overview of how to secure your Nomad clusters.

### Repo organization

* [modules](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-nomad/tree/master/modules): the main implementation code for this repo, broken down into multiple standalone, orthogonal submodules.
* [examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-nomad/tree/master/examples): This folder contains working examples of how to use the submodules.
* [test](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-nomad/tree/master/test): Automated tests for the modules and examples.
* [root](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-nomad/tree/master): The root folder is *an example* of how to use the [nomad-cluster module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-nomad/tree/master/modules/nomad-cluster) module to deploy a [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) cluster in [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/). The Terraform Registry requires the root of every repo to contain Terraform code, so we've put one of the examples there. This example is great for learning and experimenting, but for production use, please use the underlying modules in the [modules folder](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-nomad/tree/master/modules) directly.






## Deploy

### Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)
